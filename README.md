## Installation

## Usage
When the application executes, it will generate 24 table rows that correspond to the hours of the day. The data cells will include the hour, a task, the status of the task, and a save function to lock in the task. When the user types in a task in the data cell with "*" and clicks save, it will lock in the task and save it to local storage. Only table rows for the current or future hours will be editable.
